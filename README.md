# How Smart Are You?

[** Click Here to Test**](https://sidhu1512.github.io/howsmartyouare/)

A web-based benchmark tool that tests human intelligence against state-of-the-art AI models (GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, Llama 3) using official dataset questions.

## Overview
This project allows users to take simplified versions of the actual tests used to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs). After completing a quiz, the user's score is compared directly to the official reported scores of top AI models in a dynamic chart.

The application runs entirely on the client side (GitHub Pages) without a backend server.

## Benchmarks Included
The application covers six major domains used in AI evaluation:

* **MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding):** General knowledge across 57 subjects including STEM and humanities.
* **HellaSwag:** Commonsense reasoning and sentence completion.
* **ARC (AI2 Reasoning Challenge):** Grade-school science questions requiring reasoning.
* **MathQA:** Mathematical reasoning and problem-solving.
* **TruthfulQA:** A test to measure a model's tendency to reproduce falsehoods or misconceptions.
* **RACE:** Reading comprehension examinations.
